# shellscripting

This repository contains scripts for my computers, written in Bash or Powershell.

## Why am I not using other scripting languages
The thought has crossed my mind, but I've wanted these scripts to be accessible without having to install little to no extra software. I could have written these with Python or Javascript, but I kinda like the idea of just using Bash/Zsh and Powershell, since they already come preinstalled with all of my machines.

The blue and green `Languages` bar also looks kinda cool in GitHub :)
