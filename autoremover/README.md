# Autoremover

I have a folder called `TEMP` in my `Documents` folder on my Windows 11 machine.
I usually throw code snippets here that I know I won't be saving in any repositories or local folders.

I don't really want to manually remove the items every time I use the folder, so might as well write a script that would automatically remove the items when a certain condition is met. This condition could booting up the computer or reaching specific times of the day.
